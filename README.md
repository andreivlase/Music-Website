Music Website is a web application built with Spring Boot, Java, HTML/CSS, and MySQL. Users can create accounts, rate and review their favorite albums, explore all-time top albums by genre (voted by the community), view their personal profile with all past ratings and reviews, and search for albums using a built-in search feature.
